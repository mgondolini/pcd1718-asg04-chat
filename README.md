# Reactive chat service

Assignment #4 for the course of Concurrent and Distributed Programming, Unibo.

Implemented with RabbitMQ + Heroku.

Implement a distributed chat service, taking service-oriented and reactive architectures as a reference, and related methodological aspects.
The chat service must allow you to dynamically create new chats, for each of which the requirements specified in Assignment 03 (set of dynamic participants, messages to be displayed in order, optional: critical section) apply.
The service must be designed by implementing an architecture that considers non-functional aspects such as scalability (number of chats, number of users per chat), resilience, responsiveness.
